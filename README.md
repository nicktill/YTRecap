YT-Recap is an application that uses the YouTube Data API to retrieve the closed captions of a YouTube video, and then passes them to an AI model to generate a summary of the video content. The application is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Python.

# Getting Started
To use the YT-Recap application, follow these steps:

# Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the dependencies by running npm install in the root directory of the project.

Create a virtual environment and install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the python directory of the project.

Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the YouTube Data API. Follow the instructions provided by Google to obtain a YouTube Data API key.

Create a new file called .env.local in the root directory of the project, and add the following lines to the file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY
```
Replace YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY with your own YouTube Data API key.

Start the development server by running npm run dev in the root directory of the project. The application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

# Usage
To use the YT-Recap application, follow these steps:

Enter the URL of a YouTube video into the input field on the home page of the application.
Click the "Go!" button to retrieve the closed captions for the video.
Wait for the summary to be generated by the AI model. This may take a few seconds.
The summary of the video will be displayed on the same page, below the input field and button.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
